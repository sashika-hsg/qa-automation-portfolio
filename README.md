## What This Project Demonstrates

This is not a tutorial project. Every design decision is intentional, documented, and explainable. Built to showcase the full skillset expected of a Senior QA Engineer or SDET.

| Skill | Tool | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI automation | Playwright + POM | ✅ 22 tests, 3 browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit) |
| API testing — REST | Playwright request context + AJV | ✅ ReqRes + Restful Booker, 15 tests |
| Authentication flows | Static API key + cookie-based token | ✅ Both implemented |
| API testing — GraphQL | Playwright + custom GraphQLClient | ✅ 10 tests, Pokémon GraphQL API |
| Database validation | PostgreSQL + Docker + Repository pattern | ✅ 7 tests, cross-validated against API |
| API collections | Postman + Newman | ✅ 25 assertions, CI-integrated |
| Unit testing | Playwright test runner | ✅ 18 tests — framework code tested in isolation |
| Schema validation | AJV | ✅ Implemented across all API tests |
| TypeScript language depth | Generics, accessors, abstract classes, utility types | ✅ 8 core constructs implemented and test-covered |
| BDD | Cucumber.js + Gherkin | ⏳ Phase 7 |
| Security testing | Custom security spec | ⏳ Phase 8 |
| Performance testing | k6 | ⏳ Phase 8 |
| Accessibility testing | axe-core | ⏳ Phase 6 |
| Visual regression | Playwright screenshots | ⏳ Phase 6 |
| Mobile testing | Playwright viewport | ⏳ Phase 6 |
| AI integration | Claude API | ⏳ Phase 10 |
| CI/CD pipeline | GitHub Actions — 2 workflows, branch protection, auto-merge | ✅ Complete — green pipeline |
| Cloud monitoring | AWS CloudWatch | ⏳ Phase 11 |
| Reporting | Allure + Playwright HTML | ⏳ Phase 11 |

---

## Design Patterns

Every pattern is justified — not just used for the sake of it. Full reasoning, alternatives considered, and code examples are documented in [`docs/design/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`](docs/design/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md).

| Pattern | Where applied | Status | Problem it solves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Page Object Model | `src/pages/` | ✅ Implemented | Selector abstraction — one change point per UI element |
| Custom Fixtures (Factory) | `src/fixtures/fixtures.ts` | ✅ Implemented | Pre-configured page and auth state injected into tests |
| Inheritance | `ApiClient` → `ReqResClient`, `RestfulBookerClient` | ✅ Implemented | Shared HTTP methods, endpoint-specific logic in subclasses |
| Strategy | `playwright.config.ts` projects | ✅ Implemented | Pluggable browser selection (chromium/firefox/webkit) |
| Singleton | `src/db/client.ts` | ✅ Implemented | One shared PostgreSQL connection across all DB tests |
| Repository | `src/db/repositories/userRepository.ts` | ✅ Implemented | DB engine agnostic data access — SQL isolated from tests |
| Builder | `src/builders/BookingBuilder.ts`, `UserBuilder.ts` | ✅ Implemented | Readable, flexible test data construction with method chaining |

The framework also documents an intentional **non-pattern decision** — `GraphQLClient` does not extend `ApiClient`, since GraphQL's single-endpoint POST-only transport makes REST method inheritance misleading. See the design patterns doc for the full reasoning.

---

## TypeScript Language Depth

Beyond basic syntax, this framework deliberately exercises core TypeScript and OOP constructs — each implemented where it genuinely fits, not forced in for the sake of coverage.

| Construct | Where applied |
| --- | --- |
| Abstract classes & methods | `BasePage` — every page object must implement `navigate()` and `assertPageLoaded()` |
| Interfaces (`implements`) | `BasePage implements IPage` — compiler-enforced contract |
| Error handling (`try/catch`, `throw`) | `ApiClient` — every HTTP method wraps failures with contextual error messages |
| `switch/case` | `StatusCodeHandler` — maps HTTP status codes to categories |
| `get`/`set` accessors | `BookingBuilder` — validated property access with custom errors |
| Array methods (`filter`, `find`, `reduce`) | `DataUtils` — booking aggregation and search utilities |
| Generic constraints (`<T extends object>`) | `UserRepository.query<T>()` — type-safe, reusable query method |
| Utility types (`Pick`, `Omit`, `Required`, `Readonly`) | `Booking.ts` — derived types without duplicating the base interface |

| Unit Tests | Every push to every branch | Framework code in isolation — fastest fail-fast gate |
| UI Tests | PR to main or push to main | UI suite — chromium, firefox, webkit |
| API Tests | PR to main or push to main | ReqRes + Restful Booker + GraphQL |
| Database Tests | PR to main or push to main | PostgreSQL validation via Docker service container |
