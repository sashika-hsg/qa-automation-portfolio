| **v1 — Current** | 🔄 In progress — 40 tests passing, UI complete, API testing underway | Core automation framework |
| **v2 — Planned** | ⏳ Not started | Advanced tooling and cloud |

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

This is not a tutorial project. Every design decision is intentional, documented, and explainable. Built to showcase the full skillset expected of a Senior QA Engineer or SDET.

| Skill | Tool | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UI automation | Playwright + POM | ✅ 25 tests, 3 browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit) |
| API testing — REST | Playwright request context + AJV | ✅ ReqRes + Restful Booker, 15 tests |
| Authentication flows | Static API key + cookie-based token | ✅ Both implemented |
| API testing — GraphQL | Playwright + GraphQLClient | ⏳ Phase 8 — pending |
| BDD | Cucumber.js + Gherkin | ⏳ Phase 7 |
| Database validation | SQLite + Repository pattern | ⏳ Phase 5 |
| SQL | Joins, subqueries, aggregation, constraints | 🔄 Levels 1-5 complete, Level 6 in progress |
| Schema validation | AJV | ✅ Implemented across all API tests |
| Security testing | Custom security spec | ⏳ Phase 8 |
| Performance testing | k6 | ⏳ Phase 8 |
| Accessibility testing | axe-core | ⏳ Phase 6 |
| Visual regression | Playwright screenshots | ⏳ Phase 6 |
| Mobile testing | Playwright viewport | ⏳ Phase 6 |
| API collections | Postman + Newman | ⏳ Phase 9 |
| AI integration | Claude API | ⏳ Phase 10 |
| CI/CD pipeline | GitHub Actions — 2 workflows, branch protection, auto-merge | ✅ Complete |
| Cloud monitoring | AWS CloudWatch | ⏳ Phase 11 |
| Reporting | Allure + Playwright HTML | ⏳ Phase 11 |

---

## Design Patterns

Every pattern is justified — not just used for the sake of it.

| Pattern | Where applied | Status | Problem it solves |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Page Object Model | `src/pages/` | ✅ Implemented | Selector abstraction — one change point |
| Custom Fixtures (Factory) | `src/fixtures/fixtures.ts` | ✅ Implemented | Pre-configured page/auth state injected into tests |
| Inheritance | `ApiClient` → `ReqResClient`, `RestfulBookerClient` | ✅ Implemented | Shared HTTP methods, endpoint-specific logic in subclasses |
| Strategy | `playwright.config.ts` projects | ✅ Implemented | Pluggable browser selection (chromium/firefox/webkit) |
| Singleton | `ConfigManager`, `DatabaseConnection` | ⏳ Planned | One source of truth for shared resources |
| Builder | `UserBuilder`, `BookingBuilder` | ⏳ Planned | Readable, flexible test data construction |
| Repository | `src/db/repositories/` | ⏳ Planned | DB engine agnostic data access |
